### MerchTrade
MerchTrade is a message board for those who are interested in various merch of games, anime, TV series, shows, music groups, where you can conveniently buy/sell/trade your merch.
At this moment, this is only the initial stage of website development, with a basic set of functions, which I do in my free time.
Plans include adding more useful features, security, improved UI/UX, and an app for iOS and Android.
